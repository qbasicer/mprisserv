What is MPRISServ?
------------------

MPRISServ is a small HTTP server that lets you connect to any MPRIS aware
application that is currently connected through D-BUS to change it's
playback state.  It gives the user the ability to play/pause/stop and
change the track.  Designed for Clementine, it should work for any MPRIS
program.
